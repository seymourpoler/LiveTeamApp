edit deploy.sh to change version number
> bash deploy.sh
edit server.py to change version number 
> git commit -a -m "new release"
> git push heroku master

Notes:
- If new files are added to the app, grunt.js must be modified to contain those files.
- If the chat server is changed, chatServer.py must be copied to ../chatServer/chatServer.js
and then:
> git commit -a -m "new release"
> git push heroku master
- If sOn.js is updated, the minified version must be updated because it is deployed
